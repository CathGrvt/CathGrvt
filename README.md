- 👀 I’m interested in Mathematical Modelling, Data Science, Programming and anything related to science-fiction and computers!
- 🌱 I have learned how to develope my python and machine learning skills in a Clinical Data Science group and how to build solutions during competitions :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any research project that could lead me to gain as learning outcomes: 
-       How to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of systems qualitative and quantitative modelling techniques
        Learn how to develop a solid pipeline by looking into the different steps
        How to use machine-learning techniques to build prediction models
        Learn more in terms of Programming in Python with a guided direction

- 📫 How to reach me: via email or LinkedIn!
